Predict the full data, effects, and selling price of any recipe! Just pick 1-5 ingredients and click "Cook!"

## Getting Started

You'll need Node.js v8+ and Yarn.

```

That's it! You're ready to build and run.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Contributing

This is intended to be a solo project to develop and show off my skills in ES6, React, and web development. For this reason, I'm currently not accepting contributions.
