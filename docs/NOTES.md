### Image Compression

- I compressed the images loaded in `./public/img/` with the Mac OSX app "ImageOptim". It's _great_.
  - I got an average of 35% lossless compression on my PNG thumbs, and
  - About 8% lossless compression on my already-compressed JPG background image.
    - The most impressive thing about said background image: I tested out lossy compression at 85% quality for this thing. The image was compressed by a further 33%. But more importantly, _the lossily compressed image looks better than the non-lossily compressed image._
